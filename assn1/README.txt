CS 236 Assignment 1
Author: Jamella Pescasio (jpesc002)

Part 1 Notes: 
- ER Diagram is located in part1.pdf.

Part 2 Notes:
- SQL DDL statements are done in SQLite in part2.ipynb.
- Note that the database file (<database_name>.sqlite) is already included, so if you wanted to run the CREATE statements again, you would need to change the name of the database being initialized under the "Setup" section of part2.ipynb.
- The provided database file has pre-made entries inserted already for Part 3 in order to make the queries. But, if you would like to redo inserting the entries in the case you created a new database, you can do so by changing the name of the database being initialized under the "Setup" section of part3-dependency.ipynb and running all the code blocks afterwards.

Part 3 Notes:
- Query statements are done in SQLite in part3.ipynb.
- This part depends on part3-dependency.ipynb being run beforehand if you created a new database. Otherwise, the provided database file has all the entries needed to make queries.
